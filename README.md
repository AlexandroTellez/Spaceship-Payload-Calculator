# 🚀 Spaceship

**Spaceship** is a backend-focused project built with **Spring Boot**. The project demonstrates CRUD operations, database integration, RESTful API creation, and robust business logic. It serves as a solid example of backend development practices.

This **project** includes functionalities such as calculating the total weight of the items and in case the weight exceeds the set limit, it prioritises the items according to their category until the weight is within the limit. All these functions allow the spacecraft to achieve the minimum requirements to be accessible for launch and to be able to execute the space mission.

## ⚙️ Project Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository 📂

Run the following commands to clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/JesusMSM/spaceship-alex.git
cd spaceship-alex
```

### 2. Configure the Database 🗄️

* Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running. Then, configure the database as follows:

1. Create a database named `spaceship_db`.
2. Update the credentials in the `application.properties file`:

```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/spaceship_db
spring.datasource.username=alext
spring.datasource.password=**********
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true
```

### 3. Run the project ▶️

* Locally
1. Open the project in VS Code or your preferred IDE.
2. Start the application using the following command:
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

* With Docker 🐳
1. Build the Docker image:
```
docker build -t spaceship-backend .
```
2. Run the Docker container:
```
docker run -p 8080:8080 --name spaceship-container spaceship-backend
```
*Note*: Make sure Docker is installed and running before executing these commands.

#### 5. Project Steps 🛠️

Below is the **To-Do List** of tasks completed during the development of this project:

1. **Define Entities**
   - [x] Create the `Item`, `Category`, and `Calculator` classes to represent the database tables.

2. **Setup Repository**
   - [x] Build repository interfaces for database operations for each entity.

3. **Implement Service Layer**
   - [x] Encapsulate the business logic within the service classes.

4. **Design API Endpoints**
   - [x] Develop RESTful endpoints in their respective controllers.

5. **Integrate Database**
   - [x] Configure the `application.properties` file for PostgreSQL connectivity.

6. **Unit Testing**
   - [x] Develop comprehensive unit tests for the `CalculatorService` class using **JUnit**, **Mockito**, and **Spring Boot**:

#### 🧪 6.1 Unit Tests for `CalculatorService`

1. **Test to Verify That the Total Weight is Correct (Within the Weight Limit)**
   - Ensures the total weight calculated does not exceed the defined weight limit.

2. **Test to Verify That the Total Weight Exceeds the Weight Limit**
   - Confirms that the method correctly identifies when the total weight exceeds the allowed weight limit.

3. **Test When the Item is Not Found in the Repository**
   - Verifies that the service handles cases where an item is not found in the repository gracefully by throwing the appropriate exception.

4. **Test to Verify That Items with Lower Priority are Removed if Weight Exceeds the Limit**
   - Ensures that items with the lowest priority are correctly identified and removed to meet the weight limit while retaining high-priority items.

**Testing Tools and Frameworks**:
- **JUnit 5**: For defining and running unit tests.
- **Mockito**: For mocking dependencies such as the `ItemRepository`.
- **Spring Boot Test**: For integration with Spring Boot’s application context during tests.
